## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **full-stack software engineer and founder** building production-grade applications, platforms, and systems from the ground up.

I design and develop **end-to-end software** — from frontend user experience to backend logic, databases, APIs, and infrastructure. My work focuses on **real-world systems**, not tutorials.

I currently operate **my own LTD technology company**, delivering:
- Web applications  
- Full software systems  
- Internal tooling & automation  
- Scalable platforms  

I also operate a **UAB company** focused on **land ownership and cabin-stay infrastructure**, where I personally design and build **every system** — booking, admin, access, automation, and operational tooling.
