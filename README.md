## 🧠 Personal Brand

**I build complete software systems — not demos, not tutorials, not theory.**

Founder-level full-stack engineer designing and shipping **real, operational platforms** end-to-end: frontend, backend, databases, APIs, admin systems, and automation.

I own the systems I build. I understand the business they serve. I design for scale, clarity, and real-world use.

I currently run:
